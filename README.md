# Bar'acuda

A unique underwater bar management simulation game created during the Global Game Jam 2025. Take on the role of a soda jerk trying to save a struggling underwater bar by serving drinks to marine customers!

## 🎮 Game Overview

Bar'acuda is a 2D Bar Management Simulation where players serve sodas to aquatic customers. The primary objective is to raise sufficient funding within a limited time by quickly and accurately fulfilling customer orders.

## 👨‍💻 My Role & Contributions

As a core programmer on the project, I was responsible for:

- **Customer Interaction System Development:**
  - Designed and implemented the core customer interaction architecture
  - Created modular class structure to support different customer types (regular, child, influencers)
  - Developed customer satisfaction tracking and feedback systems
  - Implemented order validation and drink evaluation logic

- **System Integration:**
  - Connected customer interaction system with drink creation system
  - Added state reset functionality and object passing between systems
  - Handled asset integration and compatibility adjustments
  - Resolved field name conflicts between different components

- **Architecture Design:**
  - Used UML for initial system architecture planning
  - Created flexible frameworks adaptable to changing requirements
  - Developed modular components for future feature expansion
  - Implemented conflict prevention mechanisms between order and drink systems

- **Game Design Input:**
  - Helped structure game systems into manageable components
  - Proposed the step-by-step drink creation system
  - Suggested scope adjustments for realistic implementation
  - Contributed to core gameplay loop design

## 🎮 Core Features

### Customer Interaction System
- Random customer generation with unique marine species characteristics
